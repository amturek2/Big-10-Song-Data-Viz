Perhaps the most popular fight song is K.U.'s own ""I'm a Jayhawk."" George ""Dumpy"" Bowles, a student witht he Class of 1912, produced some outstanding student musical shows. a song in one of these shows was ""I'm a Jayhawk."" Written in 1912, it was dormant until 1920 when a great uprising of school spirit brought out ""I'm a Jayhawk"" once more. The song contributed to the raising of funds to build both the stadium and union as World War I memorials. The 1926 glee club made it known nationally.

From the KU traditions page (Revised in Fall 2010 due to changes in the Big XII; new lyrics by Matt Schoenfeld)

Down in the Tennessee hills
Ain't no smoggy smoke on Rocky Top
Ain't no telephone bills

Half bear the other half cat
Wild as a mink but sweet as soda-pop
I still dream about that

Rocky Top you'll always be
Home sweet home to me

Once two strangers climbed ol' Rocky Top
Looking for a moonshine still
Strangers ain't come down from Rocky Top
Reckon they never will
The corn won't grow at all on Rocky Top
Dirt's too rocky by far
That's why all the folks on Rocky Top
Get their corn from a jar
