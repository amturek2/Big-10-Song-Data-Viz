Got a bill that's big enough to twist the tiger's tail,
Husk some corn and listen to the cornhusker's wail
'Cause I'm a jay, jay, jay, jay, jayhawk,
Riding on a Kansas gale.

'Cause I'm a jay, jay, jay, jay, jayhawk
up at Lawrence on the Kaw
'Cause I'm a jay, jay, jay, jay, jayhawk,
With a sis-boom hip hoorah.

Got a bill that's big enough to twist the tiger's tail,
Husk some corn and listen to the cornhusker's wail
'Cause I'm a jay, jay, jay, jay, jayhawk,
Riding on a Kansas gale, and that's our team.

Perhaps the most popular fight song is K.U.'s own ""I'm a Jayhawk."" George ""Dumpy"" Bowles, a student witht he Class of 1912, produced some outstanding student musical shows. a song in one of these shows was ""I'm a Jayhawk."" Written in 1912, it was dormant until 1920 when a great uprising of school spirit brought out ""I'm a Jayhawk"" once more. The song contributed to the raising of funds to build both the stadium and union as World War I memorials. The 1926 glee club made it known nationally.

From the KU traditions page (Revised in Fall 2010 due to changes in the Big XII; new lyrics by Matt Schoenfeld)

Talk about the Sooners, Cowboys and the Bears,
Aggies and the Tiger and his tail.
Talk about the Wildcats, and the Cyclone boys,
But I'm the bird to make 'em weep and wail

'Cause I'm a Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jayhawk,
Up at Lawrence on the Kaw–
'Cause I'm a Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jayhawk,
With a sis-boom, hip hoorah,

Got a bill that's big enough
To twist a Tiger's tail,
Rope some 'Horns and listen
To the Red Raiders wail–
'Cause I'm a Jay, Jay, Jay, Jay, Jayhawk,

Our gang it is the jolliest that you have ever seen.
Our students are the finest and each one's a shining star,
Our yell, you'll hear it ringing through the mountains near and far!


Who am I, sir,
A Utah Man/Fan am I!
A Utah Man/Fan, sir,
Will be 'til I die.
Ki-yi!
We're up to snuff, we never bluff, we're game for any fuss.
No rival band of college fans dare meet us in The Muss.
So fill your lungs and sing it out and shout it to the sky,
We'll fight for dear old crimson for a Utah Man/Fan am I!
Ki-yi!

And when we prom the avenue,
All lined up in a row, and arm in arm,
And step in time as down the street we go.
No matter if a freshman green, or in a senior's gown,
the people all admit we are the warmest gang in town.
We may not live forever on this jolly good sphere,
But while we do we'll live a life of merriment and cheer,
And when our college days are o'er and night is drawing nigh,
With parting breath we'll sing that song: ""A Utah Man/Fan Am I.""
